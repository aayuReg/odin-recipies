    <h3>Ingedients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1Â½ pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded cabbage</li>
        <li>1 carrot, shredded</li>
        <li>1 onion, minced</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) package wonton wrappers</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together beef, cabbage, carrot, and onion. Stir in the egg, sugar, salt, soy sauce, and vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>Place a large teaspoonful of filling in the center of a dumpling skin. Moisten the edges of a wonton with a few drops of water. Then fold the dumpling in half, and pinch the edges together to seal. Create a ripple pattern along the pinched edge by pinching and gently pushing together small segments of it. Repeat with remaining dumplings.</li>
        <li>Boil the dumplings in water until they float to the top, about 5 minutes.</li>
